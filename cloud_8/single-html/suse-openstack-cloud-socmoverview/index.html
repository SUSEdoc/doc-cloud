  Monitoring Service operator uses the features himself for monitoring the
  operation of <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span>.
 </p><p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Application operators</strong></span> monitor the virtual
  machines on which they provide services to <span class="bold"><strong>end
  users</strong></span> or services they need for their development activities. They
  ensure that the physical and virtual servers on which their services are
  provided are up and running as required.
 </p><p>
  The <span class="bold"><strong>OpenStack operator</strong></span> monitors physical and
  virtual servers, hypervisors, and services of the underlying platform. In
  addition, he is responsible for the middleware components, for example, the
  database services.
 </p><h5><a id="id1642"></a>Metrics</h5><p>
  A Metrics Agent can be installed and configured on each physical and virtual
  server where cloud resources are to be monitored. The agent is responsible
  for querying metrics and sending the data to the Monitoring Service for
  further processing.
 </p><p>
  Metrics are self-describing data structures that are uniquely identified by a
  name and a set of dimensions. Each dimension consists of a key/value pair
  that allows for a flexible and concise description of the data to be
  monitored, for example, region, availability zone, service tier, or resource
  ID.
 </p><p>
  The Metrics Agent supports various types of metrics including the following:

  

 </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
    System metrics, for example, CPU usage, consumed disk space, or network
    traffic.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Host alive checks. The agent can perform active checks on a host to
    determine whether it is alive using ping (ICMP) or SSH.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Process checks. The agent can check and monitor a process, for example, the
    number of instances, memory size, or number of threads.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    HTTP endpoint checks. The agent can perform up/down checks on HTTP
    endpoints by sending an HTTP request and reporting success or failure to
    the Monitoring Service.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Service checks. The agent can check middleware services, for example,
    MySQL, Kafka, or RabbitMQ.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    OpenStack services. The agent can perform specific checks on each process
    that is part of an OpenStack service.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Log metrics. The agent can check and monitor the number of critical log
    entries in the log data retrieved from the cloud resources.
