  As more and more applications are deployed on cloud systems and cloud systems
  are growing in complexity, managing the cloud infrastructure is becoming
  increasingly difficult. <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span>
  helps mastering this challenge by providing a sophisticated Monitoring as a
  Service solution that is operated on top of OpenStack-based cloud computing
  platforms.
 </p>
 <p>
  The component architecture of OpenStack provides for high flexibility, yet it
  increases the burden of system operation because multiple services must be
  handled. <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> offers an
  integrated view of all services and assembles and presents related metrics
  and log data in one convenient access point. While being flexible and
  scalable to instantly reflect changes in the OpenStack platform, <span class="phrase">SUSE
  OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> provides the ways and means required to
  ensure multi-tenancy, high availability, and data security.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> covers all aspects of a
  Monitoring as a Service solution:
 </p>
 <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Central management of monitoring and log data from medium and large-size
    OpenStack deployments.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Storage of metrics and log data in a resilient way.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Multi-tenancy architecture to ensure the secure isolation of metrics and
    log data.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Horizontal and vertical scalability to support constantly evolving cloud
    infrastructures. When physical and virtual servers are scaled up or down to
    varying loads, the monitoring and log management solution can be adapted
    accordingly.
   </p>
  </li></ul></div>
 <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id1514"></a>Basic Usage Scenario</h2></div></div></div>
 
 <p>
  The basic usage scenario of setting up and using the monitoring features of
  <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> looks as follows:
 </p>
 <div class="informalfigure">
  <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/images-metricslogs.png" alt="metricslogs.png" /></div>
 </div>
 <p>
  An <span class="bold"><strong>application operator</strong></span> acts as a service
  provider in the OpenStack environment. He books virtual machines to provide
  services to <span class="bold"><strong>end users</strong></span> or to host services
  that he needs for his own development activities. <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack
  Cloud Monitoring</span> helps application operators ensure that their
  services and the servers on which they are provided are configured and
  working as required.
 </p>
 <p>
  The <span class="bold"><strong>OpenStack operator</strong></span> is a special
  application operator who is responsible for administrating and maintaining
  the underlying OpenStack platform. The monitoring and log management services
  of <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> enable him to ensure the
  availability and quality of the platform. He uses <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack
  Cloud Monitoring</span> for:
 </p>
 <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Monitoring physical and virtual servers, hypervisors, and OpenStack
    services.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Monitoring middleware components, for example, database services.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Retrieving and analyzing the log data of the OpenStack services and
    servers, the middleware components, and the operating system.
   </p>
  </li></ul></div>
 <p>
  As the <span class="bold"><strong>Monitoring Service operator</strong></span>, you are
  responsible for providing the monitoring and log management features to the
  application operators and the OpenStack operator. This enables the
  application operators and the OpenStack operator to focus on operation and
  the quality of their services and servers without having to carry out the
  tedious tasks implied by setting up and administrating their own monitoring
  software. You use the monitoring features yourself for ensuring the quality
  of <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span>.
 </p>
 <h5><a id="id1544"></a>The Monitoring Service Operator's Tasks</h5>
 <p>
  As the Monitoring Service operator, you have the following responsibilities:
 </p>
 <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Deploying the Monitoring Service, thus providing the monitoring features to
    the application operators, and the monitoring and log management features
    to the OpenStack operator.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Regular maintenance of the components and services <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack
    Cloud Monitoring</span> consists of.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Backup of the <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> databases,
    configuration files, and customized dashboards.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Monitoring of <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> to ensure
    the <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> quality. For
    monitoring, you use a graphical user interface that is seamlessly
    integrated into the cloud infrastructure. Based on OpenStack Horizon, the
    user interface visualizes the health and status of your cloud resources and
    enables user access to all monitoring and log management functionality.
   </p>
  </li></ul></div>
 <p>
  The tasks of the Monitoring Service operator and the OpenStack Operator can
  jointly be performed by one system operator. In this case, also refer to the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>OpenStack Operator's Guide</em></span>.
