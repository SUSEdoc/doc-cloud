 <p>
  The monitoring solution of <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span>
  addresses the requirements of large-scale public and private clouds where
  high numbers of physical and virtual servers need to be monitored and huge
  amounts of monitoring data need to be managed. <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud
  Monitoring</span> consolidates metrics, alarms, and notifications, as well
  as health and status information from multiple systems, thus reducing the
  complexity and allowing for a higher level analysis of the monitoring data.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> covers all aspects of a
  Monitoring as a Service solution:
 </p>
 <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Storage of monitoring data in a resilient way.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Multi-tenancy architecture for submitting and streaming metrics. The
    architecture ensures the secure isolation of metrics data.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Horizontal and vertical scalability to support constantly evolving cloud
    infrastructures. When physical and virtual servers are scaled up or down to
    varying loads, the monitoring solution can be adapted accordingly.
   </p>
  </li></ul></div>
 <h5><a id="id1623"></a>Basic Usage Scenario</h5>
 <p>
  The basic usage scenario of setting up and using the monitoring features of
  <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> looks as follows:
 </p>
 <div class="informalfigure">
  <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/images-overview-monitoring.png" alt="monitoring.png" /></div>
 </div>
 <p>
  The <span class="bold"><strong>Monitoring Service operator</strong></span> is
  responsible for providing the monitoring features to the application
  operators and the OpenStack operator. This enables the application operators
  and the OpenStack operator to focus on operation and ensure the quality of
  their services without having to carry out the tedious tasks implied by
  setting up and administrating their own system monitoring software. The
  Monitoring Service operator uses the features himself for monitoring the
  operation of <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span>.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="bold"><strong>Application operators</strong></span> monitor the virtual
  machines on which they provide services to <span class="bold"><strong>end
  users</strong></span> or services they need for their development activities. They
  ensure that the physical and virtual servers on which their services are
  provided are up and running as required.
 </p>
 <p>
  The <span class="bold"><strong>OpenStack operator</strong></span> monitors physical and
  virtual servers, hypervisors, and services of the underlying platform. In
  addition, he is responsible for the middleware components, for example, the
  database services.
 </p>
 <h5><a id="id1642"></a>Metrics</h5>
 <p>
  A Metrics Agent can be installed and configured on each physical and virtual
  server where cloud resources are to be monitored. The agent is responsible
  for querying metrics and sending the data to the Monitoring Service for
  further processing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Metrics are self-describing data structures that are uniquely identified by a
  name and a set of dimensions. Each dimension consists of a key/value pair
  that allows for a flexible and concise description of the data to be
  monitored, for example, region, availability zone, service tier, or resource
  ID.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Metrics Agent supports various types of metrics including the following:

  

 </p>
 <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    System metrics, for example, CPU usage, consumed disk space, or network
    traffic.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Host alive checks. The agent can perform active checks on a host to
    determine whether it is alive using ping (ICMP) or SSH.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Process checks. The agent can check and monitor a process, for example, the
    number of instances, memory size, or number of threads.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    HTTP endpoint checks. The agent can perform up/down checks on HTTP
    endpoints by sending an HTTP request and reporting success or failure to
    the Monitoring Service.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Service checks. The agent can check middleware services, for example,
    MySQL, Kafka, or RabbitMQ.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    OpenStack services. The agent can perform specific checks on each process
    that is part of an OpenStack service.
   </p>
  </li><li class="listitem">
   <p>
    Log metrics. The agent can check and monitor the number of critical log
    entries in the log data retrieved from the cloud resources.
   </p>
  </li></ul></div>
 <h5><a id="id1661"></a>Data Visualization and Analysis</h5>
 <p>
  All <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> user groups work with a
  graphical user interface that is seamlessly integrated into their cloud
  infrastructure. <span class="phrase">Based on OpenStack Horizon, the user interface
  enables access to all monitoring functionality and the resulting large-scale
  monitoring data.</span>
 </p>
 <p>
  A comfortable dashboard visualizes the health and status of the cloud
  resources. It allows <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> users
  to experiment with many ways of analyzing the performance of their cloud
  resources in real-time. They cannot only view but also share and explore
  visualizations of their monitoring data.
 </p>
 <h5><a id="id1667"></a>Alarms and Notifications</h5>
 <p>
  <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> supports GUI-based alarm and
  notification management. <span class="phrase">Template-based alarm definitions allow for
  monitoring a dynamically changing set of resources without the need for
  reconfiguration. While the number of underlying virtual machines is changing,
  for example, this ensures the efficient monitoring of scalable cloud
  services. Alarm definitions allow you to specify expressions that are
  evaluated based on the metrics data that is received. Alarm definitions can
  be combined to form compound alarms. Compound alarms allow you to track and
  process even more complex events. Notifications can be configured in order to
  inform <span class="phrase">SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring</span> users when an alarm
  is triggered.</span>
