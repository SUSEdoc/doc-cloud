  <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring is an out-of-the-box
  solution for monitoring <span class="productname">OpenStack</span>-based cloud environments. It is provided as
  a cloud service to users. <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring
  meets different challenges, ranging from small-scale deployments to
  high-availability deployments and deployments with high levels of
  scalability.
 </p><p>
  The core of <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring is monasca, an
  open source Monitoring as a Service solution that integrates with <span class="productname">OpenStack</span>.

  <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring is a highly scalable and
  fault tolerant monitoring solution for <span class="productname">OpenStack</span>-based cloud infrastructures.
 </p><p>
  The system operator of the cloud infrastructure and the service providers do
  not have to care for system monitoring software any longer. They use
  <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring to check whether their
  services and servers are working appropriately.
 </p><p>
  <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring provides comprehensive and
  configurable metrics with reasonable defaults for monitoring the status,
  capacity, throughput, and latency of cloud systems. <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring
  users can set their own warnings and critical
  thresholds and can combine multiple warnings and thresholds to support the
  processing of complex events. Combined with a notification system, these
  alerting features enable them to quickly analyze and resolve problems in the
  cloud infrastructure.
 </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="metrics"></a>Metrics</h3></div></div></div><p>
  The Metrics agent is responsible for querying metrics and sending them to the
  Monitoring Service for further processing.
 </p><p>
  Metrics are self-describing data structures that are uniquely identified by a
  name and a set of dimensions. Each dimension consists of a key/value pair
  that allows for a flexible and concise description of the data to be
  monitored, for example, region, availability zone, service tier, or resource
  ID.
 </p><p>
  The Metrics Agent supports various types of metrics including the following:
 </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
    System metrics, for example, CPU usage, consumed disk space, or network
    traffic.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Host alive checks. The agent can perform active checks on a host to
    determine whether it is alive using ping (ICMP) or SSH.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Process checks. The agent can check and monitor a process, for example, the
    number of instances, memory size, or number of threads.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    HTTP endpoint checks. The agent can perform up/down checks on HTTP
    endpoints by sending an HTTP request and reporting success or failure to
    the Monitoring Service.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Service checks. The agent can check middleware services, for example,
    MySQL, Kafka, or RabbitMQ.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> services. The agent can perform specific checks on each process
    that is part of an <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> service.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Log metrics. The agent can check and monitor the number of critical log
    entries in the log data retrieved from the cloud resources.
   </p></li></ul></div><p>
  Your individual agent configuration determines which metrics are available
  for monitoring your services and servers. For details on installing and
  configuring a Metrics Agent, see <a class="xref" href="book-crowbar-deployment.html" title="Deployment Guide using Crowbar"><em class="citetitle">Deployment Guide using Crowbar</em></a>.
 </p><p>
  As soon as an agent is available, you have access to the <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring
  monitoring features. You work with a
  graphical user interface that is seamlessly integrated into your cloud
  infrastructure. Based on <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> horizon, the user interface enables access
  to all monitoring functionality and the resulting large-scale monitoring
  data. A comfortable dashboard visualizes the health and status of your cloud
  resources.
 </p><p>
  <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring provides functions for alarm
  and notification management. <span class="phrase">Template-based alarm definitions allow
  for monitoring a dynamically changing set of resources without the need for
  reconfiguration. While the number of underlying virtual machines is changing,
  for example, this ensures the efficient monitoring of scalable cloud
  services. Alarm definitions allow you to specify expressions that are
  evaluated based on the metrics data that is received. Alarm definitions can
  be combined to form compound alarms. Compound alarms allow you to track and
  process even more complex events. Notifications can be configured in order to
  inform <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring users when an alarm
  is triggered.</span>
 </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="log-management"></a>Log Management</h3></div></div></div><p>
  With the increasing complexity of cloud infrastructures, it is becoming more
  and more difficult and time-consuming for the system operator to gather,
  store, and query the large amounts of log data manually. To cope with these
  problems, <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring provides
  centralized log management features.
 </p><p>
  <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring stores the log data in a
  central database. This forms the basis for visualizing the log data for the
  <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring users. Advanced data
  analysis and visualization of the log data is supported in a variety of
  charts, tables, and maps. Visualizations can easily be combined in dynamic
  dashboards that display changes to search queries in real time.
 </p><p>The log data from a large number of sources can be accessed from a
  single dashboard. Integrated search, filter, and graphics options enable
  system operators to isolate problems and narrow down potential root causes.
  <span class="phrase"><span class="phrase">SUSE <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> Cloud Crowbar</span></span> Monitoring thus provides valuable
  insights into the log data, even with large amounts of data resulting
  from highly complex environments.
 </p><p>
  Based on <span class="productname">OpenStack</span> horizon, the customizable dashboards are seamlessly
  integrated into your cloud infrastructure. They enable user access to all log
  management functionality.
 </p><p>
  GUI-based alarm and notification management is also supported for log data.
  Based on a template mechanism, you can configure alarms and notifications to
  monitor the number of critical log events over time. Compound alarms can be
  created to analyze more complex log events. This automation of log handling
  guarantees that you can identify problems in your their infrastructure early
  and find the root cause quickly.
